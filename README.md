## Introduction
Computer Vision involves processing and analyzing images to extract meaningful information. Image transformations play a crucial role in various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, image segmentation, and image enhancement. This repository aims to provide a practical introduction to some fundamental image transformation techniques.

The included Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the following transformations:
- Image resizing
- Image rotation
- Image conversion - RGB to greyscale
- Image translation
- Image smoothing/blurring
- Image upscaling/downscaling
- Corner detection

## Features
- Simple and easy-to-understand code examples
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook environment
- Visualizations to help understand the effects of each transformation
- OpenCV library for efficient image processing

## Requirements
To run the notebook locally, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```
$ pip install opencv-python matplotlib
```
## Usage
1)Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kajolshah310/basic_image_transformations_in_CV.git
```
2)Navigate to the repository's directory:
```
$ cd basic_image_transformations_in_CV
```
3)Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
Open the Basic_image_transformations.ipynb notebook and execute the cells to see the code examples and visualizations.
Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to explore additional image transformations or apply them to your own images.
